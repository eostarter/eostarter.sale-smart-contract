EOStarter is developing a Token Sale Smart Contract system that allows for the crowd-sourcing of projects through a token sale that can be configured with different parameters like staking capabilities, whitelisting requirements, token vesting, etc.

You can read about the full specs of these  Smart Contracts here:

[TOKENSALE PLATFORM - SCOPE OF WORK](https://medium.com/eostarter/eostarter-tokensale-platform-scope-of-work-4cb153c33ab6)


# Project Description
These contracts are intended to support a decentralized Token Sale platform, which allows users to set up a token sale, determine the token sale parameters, and deploy their sale onto the EOS Mainnet.

The token sale platform is a decentralized application based on open-source smart contracts that any project can use to sell its tokens.

The Web Application repository these smart contracts are designed for can be found at the [EOS Token Sale Platform GitHub Repo](https://github.com/eostarter/eostarter.sale-smart-contract)
